My research interests lie in the realm of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), specifically in Virtual Reality (VR), Haptics, Multimodal Interfaces, and Games. My work focuses on studying the way users perceive the environment under different conditions and developing interactive systems that match their perceptual characteristics.
